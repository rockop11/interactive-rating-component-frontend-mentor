## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties width modules
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vite | Typescript + SWR


### What I learned

"I undertook this project to start working with TypeScript and not end up struggling while trying to do something big. It's always better to start small, to pave the way gradually, rather than banging your head against the wall."
